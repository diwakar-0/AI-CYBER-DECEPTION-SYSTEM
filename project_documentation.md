# AI-Based Cyber Deception System Documentation

## Abstract
This project implements an AI-based intrusion detection system that leverages machine learning to identify and prevent potential cyber threats. The system analyzes various security metrics including failed login attempts, login time patterns, and abuse scores to distinguish between normal and suspicious activities. By employing a Random Forest Classifier, the system provides real-time threat detection capabilities while maintaining a balance between detection accuracy and false alarm rates.

## Problem Statement
In today's digital landscape, organizations face increasing challenges in protecting their systems from unauthorized access and cyber attacks. Traditional rule-based security systems often fail to detect sophisticated attacks and generate numerous false positives. There is a critical need for an intelligent system that can:
- Accurately identify potential security breaches
- Reduce false positive rates
- Adapt to evolving attack patterns
- Provide real-time threat detection
- Handle large volumes of security data efficiently

## Objectives
1. Develop a machine learning-based intrusion detection system
2. Implement real-time monitoring of security metrics:
   - Failed login attempts
   - Login time patterns
   - AbuseIPDB scores
3. Achieve high accuracy in threat detection while minimizing false positives
4. Create a scalable and maintainable solution
5. Provide detailed performance metrics for system evaluation

## Model Training
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Generated synthetic dataset with 1000 samples
- Features used:
  - Failed login attempts (0-5)
  - Login time (1-60 seconds)
  - AbuseIPDB score (0-100)
- Binary classification labels: 0 (Normal) and 1 (Suspicious)

### Model Architecture
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Number of estimators: 100
- Random state: 42 for reproducibility
- Train-test split: 80% training, 20% testing

### Performance Metrics
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy: Overall prediction correctness
- Precision: Ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions
- Recall: Ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives
- F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Model Persistence
- Trained model is saved as "models/intrusion_model.pkl"
- Uses joblib for efficient model serialization

## Conclusion
The implemented AI-based cyber deception system demonstrates promising results in detecting potential security threats. The Random Forest Classifier provides a robust solution for intrusion detection with the following advantages:
- High accuracy in distinguishing between normal and suspicious activities
- Ability to handle multiple security metrics simultaneously
- Scalable architecture for real-time monitoring
- Detailed performance metrics for continuous improvement

### Future Improvements
1. Integration with real-world security data
2. Implementation of additional security features
3. Development of a real-time monitoring dashboard
4. Enhancement of model performance through hyperparameter tuning
5. Addition of anomaly detection capabilities

The system provides a solid foundation for building more sophisticated security solutions and can be extended to include additional features and capabilities as needed.
