## üìù Maintenance & Usage Notes

- **Log Rotation**: The system creates log files that should be rotated periodically
- **Blocked IPs**: Blocked IPs are stored in `blocked_ips.json` and can be manually edited if needed
- **AI Model**: The intrusion detection model (`intrusion_model.pkl`) can be retrained using `python train_model.py`
- **AbuseIPDB Key**: Replace the API key in `app.py` with your own from [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)
- **Honeypot Credentials**: Customize the `HONEY_CREDENTIALS` list in `app.py` to add or modify honeypot credentials
- **Honeypot Templates**: Modify templates in the `templates/honeypot` directory to customize honeypot interfaces

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

- This system is intended for educational and testing purposes
- Do not use default credentials in production environments
- For production use, implement proper database storage instead of file-based storage
- Add SSL/TLS encryption for all traffic in production
- Consider implementing rate limiting and more advanced protection
- Ensure proper isolation of honeypot systems from production environments
